## OCLC DEVCONNECT 2018: Pre-Conference Workshop
### Tutorial Part 4 - MVC Project Organization
	
#### Model View Controller
1. Seperate Code by what it does
    - Data handling
    - Business logic
    - Display
2. Makes customization easier

#### Structure of MVC (streamlined)
1. Model directory
    - we've created `src` already
    - holds our model files
2. Views directory
    - `views`
    - holds our view files


#### Folders for Testing
1. Tests directory
    - we've created this already
    - holds our unit tests
2. Feature directory
    - We'll create this later
    - holds our automated behavior-driven acceptance tests
